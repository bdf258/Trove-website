        <p id="research-long">16.4% of UK adults – 7.1 million people – <a href="http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/building-skills-for-all-review-of-england.pdf" target="_blank">are functionally illiterate</a>, limiting their access to basic services as they
            move online. Books lead to literacy – reading for pleasure is&nbsp;<a href="https://tra-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/entries/document/3132/A_Society_of_Readers_-_Formatted__3_.pdf" target="_blank">more effective than formal literacy lessons</a>            and is one of the most important <a href="https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/CLS-WP-2013-10-.pdf" target="_blank">predictors of test scores at 16</a>. But many people don’t have access. A third of UK households have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265737802_Scholarly_Culture_and_Academic_Performance_in_42_Nations"
                target="_blank">fewer than 20 books</a> and libraries have suffered in the last&nbsp;decade.&nbsp;<a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn05875/">Funding has fallen by 37% in real terms and the number of books issued for loans has almost halved.</a><br>&nbsp;<br>Low
            literacy costs the UK economy <a href="https://mediaserver.responsesource.com/press-release/23373/WLF+-+The+Economic++Social+Cost+.pdf">£81 billion</a>.&nbsp;It costs people access to basic government services. It traps them in jobs that are
            easily automated away. Government-based interventions have obviously not worked, but maybe something else can.<br><br>I moved from Surrey to Leicestershire to find that books I wanted to read were not available from the library, only in charity
            shops. I just couldn’t find them online.<br><br>Our big-picture goal is to create a world where everyone, everywhere can access books they want to read. We will measure this by number of users and books shared, giving more weight to more deprived
            locations, using the&nbsp;<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/835115/IoD2019_Statistical_Release.pdf">Indices of Multiple Deprivation</a> as a guide.<br><br>Book sharing
            is a well developed concept. However, auditing those books so that any user can search them all has never been done. Sharing in public spaces – rather than in users’ houses – is also a new innovation. Finally, connecting users who have had
            the same book is a new way of tackling loneliness.<br><br>The technology underpinning this is not new. It was specifically chosen to be simple, dependable and cheap. QR codes are sometimes used to keep track of inventory in factories, but
            they have not been used to keep track of objects someone does not own. For scanning in large numbers of books, we will use computer vision to scan the spines on a bookcase all at once. <br><br>The system depends on community engagement. It’s
            designed to help users reach more books and for cafes to reach more customers. This funds running non-profitable troves for people who don’t want to buy coffee. Our scaling costs are marginal. We are targeting charity shops, to build the stock
            (asking users to donate them to the system when done), then Facebook book groups and independent, out-of-the-way cafes. Everyone can act out of selfish best interest and the result is many more people having access to books. <br><br>One of
            the issues faced by previous sharing economy schemes, such as <a href="https://www.freecycle.org/">Freecycle</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://olioex.com/">Olio</a>, is that users feel uneasy going to strangers’ houses or vice versa. All the sharing
            in trove is done through public spaces. This also has the advantage of many-to-many sharing rather than one-to-one, where both parties would need to be available at the same time.<br><br>Tracking who takes which object allows us to connect
            people who have taken out the same books. We have plans to make it easy to set up and run book clubs or other community events through the app too. The trove community will be a self-selected group of people interested in the same values,
            and so more likely to attend and enjoy events run by community centres, local volunteering groups, etc.<br><br>In 2001, then Secretary for Education David Blunkett lamented that “As many as seven million adults of working age in England cannot
            read or write as well as an eleven year old.” He set out a national strategy called ‘<a href="https://dera.ioe.ac.uk/9941/1/Skills%20for%20life%20-%20a%20statement%20by%20David%20Blunkett.pdf">Skills for Life</a>’ to tackle the problem. That
            number has not changed. 18 years later,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/7-to-11-years-old/reading-writing-and-maths-attainments-for-children-aged-7-to-11-key-stage-2/latest">fewer 11-year-olds reach the expected level</a>            in reading and maths. Another generation of adults will grow up to be less literate than before, in an age where literacy is even more essential.<br><br>I study behaviour change as part of user centred design. A key element of changing behaviour
            is to lower the barrier to access. We are proposing a system that can put the books where the people are: if someone must choose between library and food bank, the choice is obvious. But if there is a library in the food bank, why&nbsp;not
            grab something to read?<br><br>Trove is a social enterprise: a business designed to solve a social problem. Once running, the model is self-sustaining and doesn’t need constant grant funding to keep having an impact. We have secured a small
            amount of grant funding, but with further support, enough to affect a dozen communities. With more support, we just might help Blunkett succeed.<br></p>
