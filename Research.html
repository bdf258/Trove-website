        <h1 style="color: #232323;text-align: center;padding-bottom: 37px;">Why we're doing this</h1>
        <p id="main" class="main-text" style="color: #232323;text-align: left;">With fewer, poorer libraries and the rising price of books, many people can’t access reading materials. This problem is especially prevalent among children, who gain a huge advantage – reading for pleasure is a key predictor of test scores at
            16.&nbsp;I moved from Surrey to Leicestershire for university, and found that the books I wanted to read were just not available from libraries, yet were in many charity shops. I just couldn’t find them online.<br><br>We identified that the
            simplest, cheapest way to bring books to every child was by digitising book sharing. There is a huge wealth of unowned books at charity shops, book exchanges, train station bookcases and our own shelves – but it is impossible to find out where
            anything is without going there. What is needed is a way for people to find the books they want when they want them. <br><br>Trove builds the infrastructure for people to build databases of the books in their community, and partners with cafes
            to create places to share them. Revenue is generated from a monthly subscription from cafes, as having a trove helps new customers discover it. This revenue is used to run troves in non-profit locations such as schools, hospitals or prisons.
            The system works through a simple app and QR codes stuck on the books. When exchanging books, users scan the QR code at the trove location. Users donate one book to take another. The app identifies that a particular user has taken the book,
            the QR code identifies which copy of the book was taken, and GPS verifies the location of the transaction. This also allows tracking of footfall to each cafe due to the trove.<br><br>Book sharing is a well developed concept. However, auditing
            those books so that any user can search them all has never been done. Sharing in public spaces – rather than in users’ houses – is also a new innovation. Finally, connecting users who have had the same book is a new way of tackling loneliness.
            The technology underpinning this is not new. It was specifically chosen to be simple, dependable and cheap. QR codes are sometimes used to keep track of inventory in factories, but they have not been used to keep track of objects someone does
            not own. For scanning in large numbers of books, we will use computer vision to scan the spines on a bookcase all at once.<br>&nbsp;<br>One of the issues faced by previous sharing economy schemes, such as Freecycle or Olio, is that users feel
            uneasy going to strangers’ houses or vice versa. All the sharing in trove is done through public spaces. This also has the advantage of many-to-many sharing rather than one-to-one, where both parties would need to be available at the same
            time.<br><br>Tracking who takes which object allows us to connect people who have taken out the same books. We have plans to make it easy to set up and run book clubs or other community events through the app too. The trove community will
            be a self-selected group of people interested in the same values, and so more likely to attend and enjoy events run by community centres or volunteering groups.<br><br>16.4% of UK adults – 7.1 million people – are functionally illiterate,
            limiting their access to basic services as they move online. Books lead to literacy – reading for pleasure is more effective than formal literacy lessons and is one of the most important predictors of test scores at 16. But many people don’t
            have access. A third of UK households have fewer than 20 books and libraries have suffered this decade. Funding has fallen by 37% in real terms and the number of books issued for loan has almost halved. <br><br>The system depends on community
            engagement. It’s designed to help users reach more books and for cafes to reach more customers. This funds running non-profitable troves for people who don’t want to buy coffee. Our scaling costs are marginal. We are targeting charity shops
            first, to build the stock, then Facebook book groups and independent, out-of-the-way cafes. Every side can act out of selfish best interest and the result is many more people having easy access to book and personal connections.<br><br>Our
            big-picture goal is to create a world where everyone, everywhere can access books they want to read. We will measure this by number of users and books shared, giving more weight to more deprived locations, using the Indices of Multiple Deprivation
            as a guide.<br><br>We have a Minimum Viable Product app, (on the landing page), built using a 5k grant from Ford in June. We have tested this with users, who like the concept and believe in the mission. We are looking for our next stage of
            funding to build a more robust version of the app and integrate the computer vision feature mentioned earlier.<br><br>The remaining funds would be used to create branding packs. Rather than buy or install bookcases in cafes, we will be giving
            them vinyl stickers with the Trove logo, to put on their bookcase, and instructions for using the Trove. Doing it this way further reduces our set-up costs and creates a marketing opportunity at every shop we start at. This strategy is informed
            by JustEat’s strategy of stickers in takeaway windows, which was their most effective marketing strategy according to MD Graham Corfield.<br><br>In 2001, then Secretary for Education David Blunkett lamented that “As many as seven million adults
            of working age in England cannot read or write as well as an eleven year old.” He set out a national strategy called ‘Skills for Life’ to tackle the problem. That number has not changed. 18 years later, fewer 11-year-olds reach the expected
            result in reading and maths. Another generation of adults will grow up to be less literate than before, in an age where literacy is even more essential.<br><br>Low literacy costs the UK economy £81 billion. It costs people access to basic
            government services. It traps them in jobs that are easily automated away. Government-based interventions have obviously not worked, but maybe something else can:<br><br>I study behaviour change as part of user centred design. A key element
            of changing behaviour is to lower the barrier to access. We are proposing a system that can put the books where the people are: if someone must choose between library and food bank, the choice is obvious. But if there is a library in the food
            bank, why not grab something to read?<br><br>Trove is a social enterprise: a business designed to solve a social problem. Once running, the model is self-sustaining and doesn’t need constant grant funding to keep having an impact. The system
            grows not from altruism but economics, meaning we can use £20k to affect the lives of thousands directly. With more funding? We just might help Blunkett succeed.<br></p>
